@@ Installation:

Make sure the files called pyn_anw and xtc2bin have executable rights and
compile pyn_fort.f90:

>>> f2py -c -m pyn_fort pyn_fort.f90

@@ Example run

An example run is found in the "example" directory. Running the script
example.py will produce a full analysis of a short tip4p-ew trajectory
md_test.xtc with topology tip4p_ew.pdb

For a complete review of the commands:

@@ Notes for Archlinux

Given the fact that pynoramix is written in pyhton-2, the package python2-numpy
needs to be installed. To compile the fortran part use then 'f2py2'.
